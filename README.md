# 🛑 Real-Time Face Blur using OpenCV & Python

This project implements a real-time face blurring system using OpenCV and a pre-trained face detection model. The application detects human faces in live video streams and applies a Gaussian blur effect to anonymize them.

## 📝 Overview

This project provides an **efficient and real-time** solution for blurring faces in video streams using OpenCV’s Haar cascade or DNN-based face detection. It can be used for privacy protection in video calls, CCTV footage, or live broadcasts.

**Key Objectives:**
- Detect faces in real-time using OpenCV.
- Apply a Gaussian blur filter to anonymize detected faces.
- Process frames from a webcam, video file, or image.
